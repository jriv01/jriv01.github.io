                "Long Live the Web" allowed me to peer into the mind of the creator of the World Wide Web and understand how he feels about the direction his invention has been
                taken over the course of two decades. THe reading was interesting as it provided me with thorough information I was only somewhat acquainted with before. The
                structure of the web, basic standards, universal principles, and internet vs web were all things I was midly aware of but never took the time to look into.
                This reading gave me the chance to see what the original intenion of the Web was and how that intention has been altered. It also made me more aware of how
                some are trying to take advantage of this extremely powerful tool, and now I can recognize these malicious attempts in many aspects of my daily internet/web usage.

            <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                "As We May Think" provides a very intriguing read about developing technology through the lense of the past. I found it interesting how the author was able to
                recognize the issue of accumulating data and research versus the time to review such research, and was able to identify potentional future developments that would
                alleviate the presented issue. Reading this article nearly 70 years after it was written gave me an interesting perspective while reading, as I now know what steps
                were actually taken against this issue as opposed to just the spectulation presented in the writing. It gave me the opportunity to compare teh spectulation to real
                developments. Cleatly many of the authors claims about the future were incorrect, but I feel that they were only incorrect when it came to specific technologies.
                The idea that data needs to be transmitted and consumed rapidly is something that resonates significantly in todays world, with things like the internet ultimately
                fulflling the need that the author recognized all that time ago.
